fis-gtm (5.4-002B-1) UNRELEASED; urgency=low

  [ Luis Ibanez ]
  * Initial release, helps to close #541239
  * New upstream version
  * Modified upstream version 
    - To include files generated by MUMPS compiler.
    - In this way, this can be build with only GCC
    - Solves bootstrapping challenges.
  * debian/patches/01-comlist.patch: Ensure make will not stop
    at a to early "MAKELEVEL"
  * debian/rules:
    - override_dh_clean now uses the gtm provided "clean" make target.
    - override_dh_auto_configure now restores the extra files from the
      helper directory: fis-gtm-src-extras
    - now uses setupenv.sh from the fis-gtm-src-extras directory.
    - now using setupenv.sh for packaging and then installing
      in the override_dh_auto_install stage. Using the debian/tmp
      directory as intermediate place to expand the files packaged
      by the gtm makefile.
    - Simplify installation rules by taking advantage of the provided
      ./pro/gtminstall script.
  * debian/get-orig-source:
    - Extra source files are now expanded in fis-gtm-src-extras 
      directory, and this new directory is now part of the orig.tar.gz.
  * debian/control:
    - Add build dependencies for linux-libc-dev and gcc-multilib to
      find the header posix_type_32.h

  [ Andreas Tille ]
  * debian/changelog: switch to "uncompressed" version numbers
  * debian/watch: Added watch file
  * debian/get-orig-source:
    - Download original source tarball
    - Try to inspect index page on sourceforge for real (uncompressed)
      version number
    - unpack original tarball into separate and versioned dir
    - pack tarball as "non-dirty" tarball
    - merge in additional files needed to build without running Mumps
  * debian/rules:
    - get-orig-source target uses uscan
    - dropped info about UPSTREAM_SITE which is implicitely given
      in debian/watch
    - some files need to be cleaned up - at least after incomplete make
      processes
  * debian/control:
    - Moved lib*-dev from Depends to Build-Depends where these packages
      belong to
    - Use ${shlibs:Depends} to enable build tools to automatically detect
      which
      library is needed in Depends
    - Added Luis Ibanez to Uploaders
